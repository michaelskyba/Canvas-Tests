		<p>(From what I understand) The <a href="https://evades.io">original
		evades.io</a> was developed by Stovoy and designed by MiceLee.</p>

		<h3>What is this point of this if the original clone (on webhostapp) is
		working?</h3>

		<p>The main reason is preservation. If the original goes down, nobody will
		be able to play it anymore. This has already happened in the past with
		the "dodge" test game shown in
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU06XafPqfo">this video</a>.</p>

		<p>The lesser reason is that the original is hosted on
		000webhostapp.com. They (the owners of webhostapp) seem to serve pages
		slower than GitHub's servers do, and they also seem to place a mandatory
		banner on each page. Overall, I believe that a GitHub pages site would
		provide a better experience.</p>
