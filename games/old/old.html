		<h1>2021 and earlier</h1>

		<p>Warning: To preserve history, I've left the code of these in their
		cringey, ugly, messy states. I by no means write "clean" software now
		but it has certainly improved since then.</p>

				<p>I was very interested in Artificial Intelligence for a while
				(until I realized that you should know calculus to properly
				grasp backpropagation). Particularly, I derived immense
				satification from watching something get better and better at a
				task. I tried doing a little bit of research and then I made
				this garbage.</p>

				<p>The gray square tries to get to the yellow square without
				actually knowing where it is. Natural selection kills off
				squares that don't get close and random mutations will
				eventually lead it to the goal.</p>

				<p>Unlike an actually useful AI, each subject doesn't attempt to
				emulate a brain. It's been too long for me to remember exactly
				how I implemented it and the code is too yucky to comb through,
				but I'm pretty sure each subject was just an (x, y) offset pair.
				So, each fitness test would have it run its offset from the
				initial position and then use the Pythagorean theorem to check
				the distance.</p>

				<p>Warning: I hated making forms so there quite a few alert()
				popups at the start.</p>
