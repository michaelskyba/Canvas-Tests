Prod version
	"In the last step were running the app in 'development mode'. In dev mode,
	Svelte adds extra code that helps with debugging, and Rollup skips the final
	step where your app's JavaScript is compressed using Terser. When you share
	your app with the world, you want to build it in 'production mode', so that
	it's as small and efficient as possible for end users. To do that, use the
	build command: npm run build"
