		<h1>Falling Stars: Explanation</h1>

		<h3>Controls</h3>
		<p>In this game, you control the white square.</p>

		<img src="images/player.png" alt="Player image">

		<p>Use the arrow keys to move. While holding Shift, your movement speed
		will be split in half.</p>

		<h3>Objective</h3>

		<p>The goal of the player is to maximize their score. The score is
		increased by 1 every frame and by 200 when catching a star (see next
		section). For reference, I achieved a score of 60680 a minute ago, in
		which I would describe my skill/concentration level as "medium".</p>

		<h3>Stars</h3>
		<img src="images/star.png" alt="Star image">

		<p>Touching a star will...</p>
		<ol>
			<li>reset the star to a random position at the top of the screen</li>
			<li>increase your score by 200, as mentioned in the previous</li>
			<li>increase your lives by 1 (see next section)</li>
		</ol>

		<p>If you miss a star, it resets without any further direct punishment.</p>

		<h3>Enemies</h3>
		<img src="images/enemy.png" alt="Enemy image">

		<p>Touching an enemy will delete the enemy but decrease your number of
		lives by 1. When you run out of lives, the game is over, so you'll want
		to prolong this as long as you can by picking up stars and avoiding
		enemies.</p>

		<p>The interval between enemy spawns is displayed at the bottom of the
		screen, along with your score and lives. Each time an enemy spawns, the
		interval is decreased by 1, leading to an exponential decrease until it
		stops at 0, at which point an enemy will be spawned every frame.</p> 

		<h3>Differences from the assignment template</h3>
		<p>I...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>drew simple assets in GIMP, trying to use colours that were
			somewhat consistent with the background</li>

			<li>created an additional entity meant for the player to avoid, not catch</li>

			<li>shifted the focus of the game from catching stars to avoiding enemies</li>

			<li>created an entity array system to allow for more than one enemy
			to exist at once</li>

			<li>let the player move up and down instead of only left and right</li>

			<li>tracked an additional key (Shift) to modify the movement speed</li>

			<li>made the difficulty of the game increase as it went on instead
			of keeping it constant</li>

			<li>implemented a y velocity changing (stars fall faster as they get
			lower) and x velocity system (on the enemies)</li>

			<li>stopped the game when the player reached a "lose" state</li>
		</ul>
