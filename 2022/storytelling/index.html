			<h4>Prologue</h4>

			<p>At 17:12 on January 16th, 2023, Nicholas R. Miller was diagnosed
			with thyroid cancer. After the basic examination, the doctor
			categorized the spread as stage 1. His survival rate was estimated
			at nearly 100%, so there was nothing to worry about. The next open
			spot for the full examination and treatment was next month, which
			worked for both parties.</p>

			<p>Nicholas had been graced with near optimal health throughout his
			life and was not bothered in the slightest. Because of how busy he
			was, especially recently, he put the appointment into his Nextcloud
			Calendar and out of his mind. Instead, he further prioritized his
			thoughts on his job at Google, where he worked as a web developer on
			the Cloud Platform user interface team.</p>

			<p>The next couple of weeks felt normal. Until...</p>

		<div id="s3">
			<p>Nicholas stumbled out of bed and scampered to the opposite end of
			the bedroom. After grumbling as he searched for his phone in the
			dark, he finally found it and turned off the alarm.</p>

			<div id="t3-1">
				<p id="t3-1-1">5:31 AM</p>
				<p id="t3-1-2">Good morning, Nicholas!</p>

			<p>Pressing the sync button on his watch, the phone displayed</p>

				<p>You slept for <span class="purple">6 hours and 56 minutes</span>,
				<br>
				<span class="red">19%</span> below your target of

				<p id="t3-2-4">While sleeping, your average heart rate was

			<p>What does Nicholas do?</p>

			<input id="b3-1" type="button" value="Check today's weather.">

		</div>

		<div id="s3-1">
			<p>Nicholas then pulled open his government's official weather
			website. Every Friday, the site's user interface malfunctioned,
			making the mobile view almost completely unreadable. Nicholas cursed
			to himself about the incompetence and went to go brush his teeth,
			take a shower, and get dressed.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="s3-2">
			<p>Nicholas opened up his DeepTrend trading application and checked
			the current prices. Every company except <code>NASDAQ:META</code>
			was up.</p>

			<blockquote class="d1">
			<span>Nicholas</span>
			<hr>
			What are those lunatics doing!? How the hell is my portfolio
			supposed to reach 15% yearly growth at this rate!?
			</blockquote>

			<p>Barely holding back his sudden desire to uninstall the app,
			Nicholas went to go brush his teeth, take a shower, and get
			dressed.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="s3-3">
			<p>Nicholas recalled his reading of a meditation article on Harvard
			Health. Supposedly, there were long-term benefits, but does that
			really make any sense? How could doing nothing be productive?</p>

			<p>Reluctantly, he sat down at the edge of his living room and set a
			timer on his phone. After the first few deep breaths, his mind
			turned to his assignments at work.</p>

			<blockquote class="d1">
			<span>Nicholas</span>
			<hr>
			Whose stupid idea was it to completely change the design of the API?
			How is this any better for the user?
			</blockquote>

			<p>When he finally remembered that he was supposed to be meditating,
			it now seemed like a complete waste of time. The more time he spent
			doing nothing, the less time he would have to actually accomplish
			anything. He sat up, his timer still at 18 minutes, and went to go
			brush his teeth, take a shower, and get dressed.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="s3-4">
			<input id="b3-4" type="button" value="Continue to 6:00 AM.">
		</div>

		<div id="s4">
			<p>Nicholas shoved his work laptop into his bag and walked out the
			door of his 3-room apartment. When he got outside of the building,
			the cold, winter air attacked his exposed neck as he scuttled down
			the stairs.</p>

			<p>Trying his best not to slip on the many pools of ice around the
			sidewalk, Nicholas walked towards the bus stop. His only thoughts
			through the constant shivering were of dissatisfaction with the
			jacket he was wearing, a gift from his grandmother. Did she not
			research the materials before coming to a decision on which one to
			buy?</p>

			<p>At exactly 6:15 AM, Nicholas arrived at the stop. Looking around,
			he spotted a couple sitting on the bench, but no bus.</p>

			<blockquote class="d1">
			<span>Nicholas</span>
			<hr>
			Where's the damn bus?
			</blockquote>

			<p>One of them looked up at him with an antagonistic look.</p>

			<blockquote class="d2">
			<span>Stranger</span>
			<hr>
			You didn't see the banner on their website?
			</blockquote>

			<p>Nicholas pulled up the RelayTransit bus network’s website and saw</p>

			<div id="t4-1">
				<h3>Warning</h3>
				<p>Heavy traffic. Passenger capacity nearing for most lines
				<br>
				Your bus may be delayed by 10-20 minutes.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Nicholas squinted his eyes in disgust. What does he do?</p>

			<input id="b4-1" type="button" value="Wait for the bus.">
			<input id="b4-2" type="button" value="Call an Uber ride.">
			<input id="b4-3" type="button" value="Go home and take the day off.">
		</div>

		<div id="s4-1">
			<p>Nicholas bit his lip and opened a new tab in his browser,
			navigating to Google Reviews.</p>

			<div id="t4-1-1">
				<h5>Review: RelayTransit</h5>
				<p id="t4-1-1-1">Nicholas Miller:
				<span class="google-yellow">★</span><span class="gray">☆☆☆☆</span></p>

				<p id="t4-1-1-2">RelayTransit is the worst transportation network I’ve ever
				had the displeasure of working with. The buses themselves are
				old and unpolished, the service is meager, and the schedules are
				never consistent. Today, for example, I lost over 15 minutes fo
				no reason! Worst of all, the prices they charge for this garbage
				are never even remotely reasonable. If you have any other
				option, avoid RelayTransit at all costs.</p>
			</div>

			<p>As the bus finally arrived, the edge of his lips curved slightly
			upwards at the thought that RelayTransit would atone for wasting his
			time. He rushed to board it ahead of the other people that had
			gathered around the stop, sensing that there would not be many seats
			left. Sure enough, the seat he took seemed to be the last open one
			in the entire bus. After more of the passengers boarded the bus, the
			last one was a young student, probably in high school, holding what
			looked suspiciously looked like the case of an alto saxophone.</p>

			<p>Nicholas scoffed. Kids have nothing to do all day, huh? Music is
			such a waste of time.</p>

			<p>After forty minutes or so, the bus arrived at stop #62. Nicholas
			hurried outside, not even considering the idea of saying thank you
			to the driver. Looking up, he saw his company’s logo on the
			building across the street.</p>

			<p id="t4-1-2">
				<span class="google-blue">G</span><span class="google-red">o</span><span class="google-yellow">o</span><span class="google-blue">g</span><span class="google-green">l</span><span class="google-red">e</span>
			</p>

			<p>Nicholas sighed as he pulled the company lanyard out of his bag
			and onto his neck, displaying his name, department ID, and
			position.</p>

			<input id="b4-1-1" type="button" value="Enter the office.">
		</div>

		<div id="s4-2">
			<p>Nicholas opened his Uber client app and entered the location of
			both the bus stop and his office building.</p>

			<div id="t4-2-1">
				<h4>Uber Details</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>Estimated price: <span class="google-green">USD$47.12</span></li>
				<li>Estimated duration: 38 minutes</li>
				<li>Estimated time of driver arrival: 2 minutes</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p>Did they up the rate again? What is wrong with this company?
			Nicholas bit his lip and reluctantly pressed the “Order”
			button.</p>

			<p>Once the driver arrived, Nicholas confirmed his identity and
			hopped inside the car, which sped off towards his destination.</p>

			<blockquote class="d2">
			<span>Driver</span>
			<hr>
			A lot of people waiting for the bus, huh?
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="d1">
			<span>Nicholas</span>
			<hr>
			Is that supposed to be an insightful comment? Everyone knows that
			RelayTransit is run by utter criminals. At least the half of a brain
			you Uber wagies have is enough for showing up on time.
			</blockquote>

			<p>The driver averted his eyes, and they didn’t talk for the rest
			of the trip. After about 35 minutes, a little bit ahead of schedule,
			they arrived at the Google parking lot.</p>

			<blockquote class="d2">
			<span>Driver</span>
			<hr>
			Make sure not to forget anything behind in the car, and have a nice
			day.
			</blockquote>

			<p>Without a sound of reply, Nicholas stepped out and slammed the
			door, his thoughts turning to what he was going to burn the time in
			the work day. He set out towards the Google office building in the
			distance.</p>

			<input id="b4-2-1" type="button" value="Enter the office.">
		</div>

		<div id="s4-3">
			<p>Nicholas decided that work wasn’t worth his time today and sent
			a message to his manager, George.</p>

			<p>Audibly scoffing, he turned around and started back towards his
			apartment building. The way back felt twice as cold; RelayTransit
			stole his time coming here, and now it’s stealing his time coming
			back.</p>

			<p>Eventually, he made it to the icy front steps, to the entrance
			lobby, to the double elevators, and then to his apartment. He looked
			around at the bare living room, completely empty except for his
			laptop, his desk, and his chair.</p>

			<p>Nicholas then decided that if he’s taking a break from formal
			work, he might as well take a break from informal work. Instead,
			now’s the perfect time to play something. So, Nicholas sat down at
			the desk and booted up League of Legends, hoping to win some games
			and increase his matchmaking rating.</p>

			<p>During the first few hours, it went fine enough. Nicholas, for
			the first time in the day, felt some control over himself. Somewhat
			satisfied, he took a break by going to the other side of the room
			and staring at the blank, white wall.</p>

			<p>As his brain recovered from the nonstop exposure, he heard his
			phone’s ringtone go off. His face turned red with irritation when
			he realized it was his colleague. He was supposed to be avoiding
			Google today, not pursuing work from home!</p>

			<div id="t4-3-1">
				<h3>New SMS messages (1): Luna</h3>
				<p>Can you explain your implementation of the calendar component
				on the billing screen? I don’t see why you went for a
				structure with bidirectional data flow, and it’s impeding the
				API switch.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Instead of replying, Nicholas set his phone to Airplane mode and
			went back to League of Legends.</p>

			<p>This time, however, nothing was going his way. After losing for
			the sixth time in a row, Nicholas lost his patience. He toxicity
			doubled and he began attacking the other players in the lobby.</p>

			<pre>[17:56] <span class="google-blue">nickrm (Teemo)</span>: wtf are you doing you idiot
[17:56] <span class="google-blue">nickrm (Teemo)</span>: why tf did you join the lobby if all you know how to do is walk into the enemy jungle when they have no positive pressure
[17:57] <span class="google-blue">nickrm (Teemo)</span>: go uninstall the game and get a life
[17:59] <span class="google-blue">msk (Akshan)</span>: ok</pre>

			<p>Half way through the next game, Nicholas slammed his laptop shut
			and walked away from the desk. Suddenly…</p>

			<input id="b4-3-1" type="button" value="Feel a strange sensation...">
		</div>

		<div id="s5-1">
			<p>Nicholas entered the office and headed to the second floor, where
			his desk was. His colleagues were already there, so he slipped in
			quietly to avoid having to utter any greetings.</p>

			<p>When he got his laptop open, it still had the bug tracker open
			from yesterday. It didn’t feel like an interesting thing to do, so
			he closed his browser, put on his headphones, and opened up his TV
			streaming client.</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, Luna, the core contributor on Nicholas’s team, was
			changing client URL endpoints. It wasn’t the most intellectually
			intensive work, but it was necessary, since it seemed like Nicholas
			had not completed it yet.</p>

			<p>For the first little while, progress was steady, but then she
			came to a roadblock: the calendar component on the billing screen.
			Unlike the rest of the page, this component was both directly
			sending and receiving data from its parent component. Why? The API
			redesign wouldn’t be compatible with this kind of layout.</p>

			<p>Then, she remembered who created this part of the code. She
			rolled her chair to the right, where Nicholas was supposed to sit,
			and saw him with his laptop and his headphones, listening to
			something. When did he come in?</p>

			<blockquote class="d3">
			<span>Luna</span>
			<hr>
			Nicholas?
			</blockquote>

			<p>There was no response, but after waving her hand, Nicholas
			noticed the movement, took off his headphones, and looked up at her.
			The expression on his face emanated an aura of “What makes you
			think you have the right to annoy me?”</p>

			<p>After hearing her concern, Nicholas told her that he would
			convert it later and that he was busy right now. He then went back
			to watching his show as if nothing had happened.</p>

			<p>Luna sighed and switched focus to the bug backlog. She wrote off
			the API consumption redesign, which was supposed to be more urgent,
			as “blocked: waiting on Nicholas”.</p>

			<p>At exactly 5:00 PM, Nicholas packed his laptop bag into his bag
			and strolled away from his desk. On his way out, he noticed George,
			his manager, standing by the door. Before he could turn around and
			find a different exit, George spotted him and walked over.</p>

			<blockquote class="d4">
			<span>George</span>
			<hr>
			Hey Nicholas. How’s the API change going? Is next week’s
			deadline still fine?
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="d1">
			<span>Nicholas</span>
			<hr>
			Uhhh… yeah, sure, good progress.
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="d4">
			<span>George</span>
			<hr>
			That’s great to hear! Keep up the amazing work, Nicholas.
			</blockquote>

			<p>Nicholas looked down and hurried out of the office. He eagerly
			got back onto the bus, which arrived on schedule this time, and rode
			back to his apartment.</p>

			<p>Once he was inside, Nicholas put his bag down and stood in the
			center of his living room, looking at the wall. Suddenly…</p>
