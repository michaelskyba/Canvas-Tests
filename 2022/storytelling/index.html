			<h4>Prologue</h4>

			<p>At 17:12 on January 16th, 2023, Nicholas R. Miller was diagnosed
			with thyroid cancer. After the basic examination, the doctor
			categorized the spread as stage 1. His survival rate was estimated
			at nearly 100%, so there was nothing to worry about. The next open
			spot for the full examination and treatment was next month, which
			worked for both parties.</p>

			<p>Nicholas had been graced with near optimal health throughout his
			life and was not bothered in the slightest. Because of how busy he
			was, especially recently, he put the appointment into his Nextcloud
			Calendar and out of his mind. Instead, he further prioritized his
			thoughts on his job at Google, where he worked as a web developer on
			the Cloud Platform user interface team.</p>

			<p>The next couple of weeks felt normal. Until...</p>

			<p>Beep! Beep! Beep!</p>

		<div id="s3">
			<p>Nicholas stumbled out of bed and scampered to the opposite end of
			the bedroom. After grumbling as he searched for his phone in the
			dark, he finally found it and turned off the alarm.</p>

			<div id="t3-1">
				<p id="t3-1-1">5:31 AM</p>
				<p id="t3-1-2">Good morning, Nicholas!</p>
			</div>

			<p>Pressing the sync button on his watch, the phone displayed</p>

			<div id="t3-2">
				<p>You slept for <span class="purple">6 hours and 56 minutes</span>,
				<br>
				<span class="red">19%</span> below your target of
				<span class="purple">8 hours and 15 minutes</span>.</p>

				<p id="t3-2-4">While sleeping, your average heart rate was
				<span class="pink">58 beats per minute</span>,

			<p>What does Nicholas do?</p>

			<input id="b3-1" type="button" value="Check today's weather">
			<input id="b3-2" type="button" value="Check today's stock prices">
			<input id="b3-3" type="button" value="Meditate for 20 minutes">

		<div id="s3-1">
			<p>Nicholas then pulled open his government's official weather
			website. Every Friday, the site's user interface malfunctioned,
			making the mobile view almost completely unreadable. Nicholas cursed
			to himself about the incompetence and went to go brush his teeth,
			take a shower, and get dressed.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="s3-2">
			<p>Nicholas opened up his DeepTrend trading application and checked
			the current prices. Every company except <code>NASDAQ:META</code>
			was up.</p>

			<blockquote class="d1">
			<span>Nicholas</span>
			<hr>
			What are those lunatics doing!? How the hell is my portfolio
			supposed to reach 15% yearly growth at this rate!?
			</blockquote>

			<p>Barely holding back his sudden desire to uninstall the app,
			Nicholas went to go brush his teeth, take a shower, and get
			dressed.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="s3-3">
			<p>Nicholas recalled his reading of a meditation article on Harvard
			Health. Supposedly, there were long-term benefits, but does that
			really make any sense? How could doing nothing be productive?</p>

			<p>Reluctantly, he sat down at the edge of his living room and set a
			timer on his phone. After the first few deep breaths, his mind
			turned to his assignments at work.</p>

			<blockquote class="d1">
			<span>Nicholas</span>
			<hr>
			Whose stupid idea was it to completely change the design of the API?
			How is this any better for the user?
			</blockquote>

			<p>When he finally remembered that he was supposed to be meditating,
			it now seemed like a complete waste of time. The more time he spent
			doing nothing, the less time he would have to actually accomplish
			anything. He sat up, his timer still at 18 minutes, and went to go
			brush his teeth, take a shower, and get dressed.</p>

		<div id="s3-4">
			<input id="b3-4" type="button" value="Continue to 6:00 AM">
		</div>

		<div id="s4">
			<p>Nicholas shoved his work laptop into his bag and walked out the
			door of his 3-room apartment. When he got outside of the building,
			the cold, winter air attacked his exposed neck as he scuttled down
			the stairs.</p>

			<p>Trying his best not to slip on the many pools of ice around the
			sidewalk, Nicholas walked towards the bus stop. His only thoughts
			through the constant shivering were of dissatisfaction with the
			jacket he was wearing, a gift from his grandmother. Did she not
			research the materials before coming to a decision on which one to
			buy?</p>

			<p>At exactly 6:15 AM, Nicholas arrived at the stop. Looking around,
			he spotted a couple sitting on the bench, but no bus.</p>

			<blockquote class="d1">
			<span>Nicholas</span>
			<hr>
			Where's the damn bus?
			</blockquote>

			<p>One of them looked up at him with an antagonistic look.</p>

			<blockquote class="d2">
			<span>Stranger</span>
			<hr>
			You didn't see the banner on their website?
			</blockquote>

			<p>Nicholas pulled up the RelayTransit bus networkâ€™s website and saw</p>

			<div id="t4-1">
				<h3>Warning</h3>
				<p>Heavy traffic. Passenger capacity nearing for most lines
				<br>
				Your bus may be delayed by 10-20 minutes.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Nicholas squinted his eyes in disgust. What does he do?</p>

			<input id="b4-1" type="button" value="Wait for the bus">
			<input id="b4-2" type="button" value="Call an Uber ride">
			<input id="b4-3" type="button" value="Go home and take the day off">
