			<h4>Prologue</h5>

			<p>At 17:12 on January 16th, 2023, Nicholas R. Miller was diagnosed
			with thyroid cancer. After the basic examination, the doctor
			categorized the spread as stage 1. His survival rate was estimated
			at nearly 100%, so there was nothing to worry about. The next open
			spot for the full examination and treatment was next month, which
			worked for both parties.</p>

			<p>Nicholas had been graced with near optimal health throughout his
			life and was not bothered in the slightest. Because of how busy he
			was, especially recently, he put the appointment into his Nextcloud
			Calendar and out of his mind. Instead, he further prioritized his
			thoughts on his job at Google, where he worked on the Cloud Platform
			user interface team.</p>

			<p>The next couple of weeks felt normal.</p>

			<h4>2023-01-27</h5>

			<p>Beep! Beep! Beep!</p>

			<p>Nicholas stumbled out of bed and scampered to the opposite end of
			the bedroom. Grumbling as he searched for his phone in the dark, he
			finally found it and turned off the alarm.</p>

			<div id="t2-1">
				<p id="t2-1-1">5:31 AM</p>
				<p id="t2-1-2">Good morning, Nicholas!</p>
			</div>

			<p>Pressing the sync button on his watch, the phone displayed</p>

			<div id="t2-2">
				<p>You slept for <span id="t2-2-1">6 hours and 56 minutes</span>,
				<br>
				<span id="t2-2-2">19%</span> below your target of
				<span id="t2-2-1">8 hours and 15 minutes</span>.</p>

				<p id="t2-2-4">While sleeping, your average heart rate was
				<span id="t2-2-3">58 beats per minute</span>,
				<br>
				<span id="t2-2-2">29%</span> above your target of
				<span id="t2-2-3">45 beats per minute</span>.</p>

			<p>What does Nicholas do?</p>

			<input id="b2-1" type="button" value="Check today's weather">
			<input id="b2-2" type="button" value="Check today's stock prices">
			<input id="b2-3" type="button" value="Meditate for 20 minutes">

			<p>Nicholas then pulled open his government's official weather
			website. Every Friday, the site's user interface malfunctioned,
			making the mobile view mostly unreadable. Nicholas cursed to himself
			about the incompetence and went to go brush his teeth, take a
			shower, and get dressed.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="s2-2">
			<p>Nicholas opened up his DeepTrend trading application and checked
			the current prices. Every company except <code>NASDAQ:META</code>
			was up.</p>

			<blockquote>

			What are those lunatics doing!? How the hell is my portfolio
			supposed to reach 15% yearly growth at this rate!?
